🍞 FoodPass NFT

Blockchain-based Food Assistance System on Algorand TestNet

FoodPass NFT is a Web3 social-good MVP built on Algorand TestNet, designed to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in humanitarian food assistance programs.

The project replaces paper food vouchers with non-transferable NFT FoodPasses, ensuring that aid reaches the right beneficiaries while allowing NGOs and donors to track impact in real time.

🌍 Problem Statement

In many humanitarian aid programs, food assistance suffers from:

Loss or theft of paper vouchers

Fraud and misuse of aid

Lack of transparency for donors

Difficult tracking of distributions and redemptions

Manual, error-prone administrative processes

These issues reduce trust and prevent aid from reaching families who need it most.

💡 Solution: FoodPass NFT

FoodPass NFT introduces a secure, transparent, and auditable food assistance system using blockchain technology.

Each beneficiary family receives a non-transferable NFT FoodPass

Merchants redeem meals or food value directly from the pass

NGOs manage campaigns and monitor distribution via a real-time dashboard

All transactions are recorded on Algorand TestNet for transparency
